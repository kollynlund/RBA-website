		<h1>Have strong coaching engagements to boost sales.</h1>
		<p>The patent pending MyRoadmap Engagement Platform&trade; is a formalized and structured methodology to measure and improve the personal engagement between a sales manager and their reps. It helps hold both the rep and his/her manager accountable by facilitating learning, feedback, communication, and engagement.</p>
		<p>In a world where managers are skeptical about coaching, you as an organization need to provide a framework for coaching that isn’t over engineered and that doesn’t require them to dramatically change their behavior. It shouldn't require a bunch of hoops, training, or administration. It should provide starter questions to help facilitate coaching discussions.</p>

				<p>"I love the idea of having a more visual way to evaluate our progress. It allows us to see more objectively the areas where we have made improvement (to feel proud of ourselves) and the areas where we need improvement to address more specifically."</p>
				<p>"I like that I can go back to it when I need reassurance. Along the way, we struggle to be confident about ourselves. It is very easy to think that we are stuck. Seeing the facts, of what we have learned, the progress we have made and the constant support we get, is vital to take us out of those setbacks."</p>
