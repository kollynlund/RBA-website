				<h2>PRIVACY STATEMENT</h2><b style="margin-bottom:1.5em;">Updated on January 1, 2019</b>

				<p>This privacy statement explains how MyRoadmap handles personal data collected during the normal course of business (sales, marketing, and support), as well as how data are processed in its software and services.</p>

				<b>1. MYROADMAP SOFTWARE AND SERVICES.</b>

				<p>MyRoadmap provides software and services that measure and improve personal engagement. The software is provided in an Application Service Provider (ASP) model, accessed using a modern browser via the Internet. All of MyRoadmap products are self-service, whereby the end-users are solely responsible for what data to collect and from whom. End-users may access the software using mobile devices.</p>

				<p>All customer data collected using the software are stored in a single secure data center; data do not “float” around in the cloud.</p>

				<p>Software and services may be distributed in numerous ways: via email, a web link, off-line mobile app, or hard copy. Software may require a password or other authentication by the end-user.</p>

				<b>2. DATA COLLECTED DURING NORMAL BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS (UNRELATED TO THE SOFTWARE)</b>

				<p>For the <a ui-sref="home">www.MyRoadmap.io</a> site: MyRoadmap collects and analyzes aggregate information of visitors, including the domain name, visited surveys, referring URLs, and other publicly available information. We use this information to help improve our website and services, and to customize the content of our pages for each individual customer. Cookies may be used to deliver customized content to website visitors. No personal data are collected when browsing this site.</p>

				<p>MyRoadmap does not sell or make available specific information about our end-users except as requested by a valid court order or otherwise required by law. We maintain a database of user information which is used only for internal purposes such as technical support, marketing-related activities, and to notify customers of changes or enhancements to the services. MyRoadmap uses secure third-party services for online credit card payment transactions, and does not record or store credit card information on its site or servers.</p>

				<b>3. DATA COLLECTED BY CUSTOMERS</b>

				<p>For this section, customers are end-users with valid MyRoadmap accounts. Customers own and control all information input into the MyRoadmap software or generated on behalf of customers in connection with the Services (“Data”). Depending on how the Customer chooses to use the software, Data may include personal information. Customers manage all Data, as well as the users who create, manage, distribute, or report the Data.</p>

				<p>MyRoadmap treats all Data as highly confidential and does not classify or represent the Data because only the Customer itself knows what data it’s collecting. In other words, MyRoadmap provides the services, and Customers use the services as they wish. All Data are safeguarded using industry best security practices that prevent unlawful disclosure.</p>

				<p>MyRoadmap will process Data for the purpose of providing the software and services to customers. MyRoadmap may also anonymize and aggregate the Data and use such anonymized and aggregated data for its business purposes. Customers must ensure that they follow applicable laws when distributing surveys. This includes following applicable law when collecting personal and health information, preventing unsolicited emails from being sent, and deleting personal information when no longer required. Unless required by law, MyRoadmap will never transfer Data to a third-party without the written permission of the customer. In other words, there is no onward transfer.</p>

				<p>MyRoadmap enables Customers to be compliant with various privacy-related regulations and laws. Features within the products may be used to modify and delete data, and more.</p>

				<p>MyRoadmap employees do not actively view Data. Any access to Customer accounts requires consent by the end-user, and any exposure to personal information is incidental to providing the services. Customers have the ability to disable MyRoadmap support from accessing their accounts, but doing so may hinder timely responses and the quality of support.</p>

				<b>4. COMPLAINTS AND INQUIRIES</b>

				<p>MyRoadmap is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and individuals have a right to contact the FTC regarding services provided by MyRoadmap.</p>
